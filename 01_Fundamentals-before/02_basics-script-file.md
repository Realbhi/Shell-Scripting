### Basic Example of Shell Script!

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user for their name
echo "Hello! What's your name?"
read name

# Greet the user
echo "Nice to meet you, $name!"
```

To use this script:
1. Save it to a file (e.g., `greeting_script.sh`).
2. Make it executable using `chmod +x greeting_script.sh`.
3. Run the script using `./greeting_script.sh`.
