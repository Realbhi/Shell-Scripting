**Variables and data types in shell scripting, along with examples:**

---

**1. Declaring Variables:**
In shell scripting, you can declare variables without specifying their data types. Variables are case-sensitive and can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores, but they must start with a letter or underscore. Here's how you declare a variable:

```bash
variable_name=value
```

**2. Variable Types:**
Shell scripting doesn't have strict data types like other programming languages. Variables are treated as strings by default, but you can manipulate them to behave as different types.
